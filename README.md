# ImageClassification 

Machine learning, Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
This is a project of course AIML421. The objectives are using CNNs to building the popeline of basic image Classification. 
Dataset is an image classification dataset, which has 3 classes are tomato, cherry, and strawberry. 
The project will follow the image processing, image classidifcation (PyTorch/torchvision). 

Aiml421 project code
train.ipynb is jupyter notebook python can by run on anaconda or colab. It is for train the CNN model. 
test.ipynb is jupyter notebook python can by run on anaconda or colab. It is for load the model and load the testdata set.
model.pth is saved image classification Pytorch cnn.model.
testdata fold contain three sub directories which are Cherry, Strawberry, Tomato of the three class images.
