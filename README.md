# ImageClassification 
Machine learning, Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
This is a project of course AIML421. The objectives are using CNNs to building the popeline of basic image Classification. 
Dataset is an image classification dataset, which has 3 classes are tomato, cherry, and strawberry. 
The project will follow the image processing, image classidifcation (PyTorch/torchvision).
